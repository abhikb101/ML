I have attempted to solve this problem using random forests, and have followed the following steps:-
1)importing the libraries
2)importing the data
3)checking the data for null/missing values
4)describing the data
5)removing the features that were irreleveant
6)training the random forest classifier using test data 
7)prediciting the label for the test case
8)exporting the results
